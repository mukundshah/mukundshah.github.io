        Hello there! üëã
      </h2>
      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        I‚Äôm <NuxtLink to="/" class="text-fuchsia-400 underline underline-offset-2">
          Mukund Shah
        </NuxtLink>, your friendly neighborhood full stack web developer, hailing from the vibrant streets of Kathmandu, Nepal. üöÄ

        <br /><br />
        I‚Äôve caught wind you‚Äôre scouting for a "Staff Software Engineer" and guess what? I‚Äôm on a mission to level up to that rank.
        I am not quite there yet but bursting with eagerness and ready to sprint (or code) my way up to that level.
        <br /><br />

        Why, you ask? Well, I'm a quick learner with a heart set on mastering the art of low-level programming.
        Go and Rust are my new playgrounds I explore in my free time. Sure, the perks and pay are cool and all, but for me, it's all about the thrill of learning and soaking in the experience (ain't just saying that to butter you up, promise! üòÑ).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl text-neutral-100">
        Now, let's chat about time zones and legal jazz
      </h2>

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        First things first, I‚Äôm already part of a team here, working the 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM shift, UTC+5:45. But as the clock ticks past 6:30 PM UTC+5:45, I‚Äôm ready to dive into new adventures with you.
        <br /><br />
        From 6:30 PM to 11:00 PM, I'm all set to collaborate, ensuring we have ample time to work together directly. And yes, we're talking about a solid 40-hour week commitment from my end. The rest of those hours? I‚Äôll be fitting them in flexibly around my other commitments. And don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm pretty good at managing my time, so I might even sneak in a bit more work during the midnight if needed. But hey, rest easy about my health and sleep; I‚Äôve got that all balanced out. Your project and my well-being will both be in top shape!
        <br /><br />
        Still in college and navigating through my Senior year, I‚Äôll need a little breather during finals, but that‚Äôs the only pause on my journey. And don‚Äôt worry, the legal checkboxes for remote work and international travel are all ticked off on my end!
      </p>
      <!--
      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        I'm still college, second half of my Junior year, and during my finals I will need 2 weeks of break. I don't have classes fromnow onwards though.
      </p>

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        Regarding legalities, I'm allowed to do remote work from my country, Nepal. I have a valid passport for international travel and I can travel when and if required.
        My current employer is aware of my job search and they are okay with me doing a second job, as long as it doesn't affect my current job.
      </p> -->

      <h2 class="text-xl text-neutral-100">
        Why am I on this quest for a second job, you ask? ü§î
      </h2>

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        Simple. I'm in love with my current job and the awesome folks I work with. But, a guy's got dreams, right? Financial goals to meet and a burning curiosity for low-level programming that just won't quit. Plus, these low-level languages have been calling my name, and I can't help but answer.
        <br /><br />
        And, just to ease your mind, my current employer is cool üòé with my quest for a new adventure as long as I keep rocking it at my day job.

        Let's dive into my tech world! üåê
      </h2>

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        I've been weaving the web as a full stack developer for the past 3 years. From React to Django and everything in between, I've had my hands on it.
        <br /><br />
        And oh, TailwindCSS?
        <br /><br />
        It's been my styling partner in crime from day one. I've even nudged my team to embrace its magic.

        <br /><br />
        For a while HeadlessUI had been a go-to, but Radix UI has recently stolen the spotlight for its performance and snazzy components.
        <br /><br />
        I'm really rooting for HeadlessUI to pack in more goodies and zip up its performance‚Äîthat'd be a game-changer for me! My radar‚Äôs been buzzing with updates on Catalyst UI and HeadlessUI‚Äôs version 2. Sadly, they‚Äôre still in the React camp, which I waved goodbye to a while back. But who knows? The future‚Äôs full of surprises!

        <br /><br />

        Oh, React and I? We‚Äôve had our dance, and though it led me to discover my groove with Vue, there‚Äôs no bad blood. React's got its charms, but Vue stole my heart. I‚Äôm all for keeping an open mind, though‚Äîif the winds change and there‚Äôs a compelling reason to tango with React again, I'm there. Until then, I‚Äôm happily exploring new horizons, eyes wide for the next big thing in web development.

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        While I haven‚Äôt yet had the chance to contribute directly to Tailwind CSS and HeadlessUI, I've been buzzing around their Discord server, soaking up knowledge and jumping into conversations. Being part of the community, even in small ways, feels pretty awesome!

      </p>

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        Oh, and the plot thickens with a bit of sleuthing and sprucing up I've done around the Nuxt ecosystem! My journey has also taken me through the digital halls of

          <span class="text-fuchsia-400 underline underline-offset-2">Nuxt</span>

        leaving my mark with minor contributions that, fingers crossed, make the experience just a bit smoother for everyone. Every little bit counts, right? It's all about adding value where I can, learning heaps along the way, and being part of something bigger than myself. Can't wait to dive even deeper!

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        And keep this between us‚ÄîI've got an open source project up my sleeve. It's called     <NuxtLink to="https://nxse.vercel.app/">

        Low-Level Adventures üöÄ
      </h2>

      <p class="w-auto leading-6">
        My curiosity has recently steered me towards the intriguing world of low-level programming, particularly with Rust and Go. While I'm still at the starting blocks, absorbing knowledge through books and tutorials, the excitement of creating something from scratch in these languages is palpable.

        <br /><br />

        My latest endeavor involves delving into WebAssembly with Rust. I'm on a quest to develop an image resize library that's lean enough to operate within Cloudflare's worker environment, which has a 128MB memory cap. The goal is to add this functionality alongside the <NuxtLink to="https://github.com/nuxt/image">
          <span class="text-fuchsia-400 underline underline-offset-2">Nuxt Image</span>
        </NuxtLink> module, providing support where Sharp‚Äîa Node.js module‚Äîfalls short due to compatibility issues with Cloudflare's workers. This exploration is about expanding capabilities and enhancing performance with cutting-edge web technologies.

        <br /><br />

        As for Go, my journey took me through fascinating projects, including web scraping, a while back. While I've shelved Go for the moment, the door is always open for a return. Currently, my heart is set on Rust and its potential to revolutionize how I approach problem-solving in web development. The path ahead is thrilling, and I can't wait to see where these low-level adventures lead me.
